# Weather

In order to use the app, you must install the Pods since Alamofire is used as a dependency for the networkin.

A test Apikey is included in the Secret file. This file must be removed from the repository and added to gitIgnore before going live.

The API used to obtain weather information is https://home.openweathermap.org/
